# PyBer Analysis

## Project overview
The purpose of this project was to create a notebook that showed a weekly brake down of 
PyBer's fares based on the type of city (Rural, Suburban, Urban). 
we wanted needed to find:
- The total number of rides 
- The total number of drivers
- The sum of the fares 
- The average fare per ride
- The average fare per driver
From these values we created a DataFrame to store them.
From this we wanted to the fares for each of the city types over the corse of time.
So we divided the data up into weekly bins and displayed them into a line graph where the
x-axis was time and the y-axis was the total fares for each city type.

### Results
From the data frame, we can see that there seems to be a correlation between the total number of rides and the population of the city.
This also ment that in these higher populated cities there were also more drivers. The interesting thing to be mentioned is that in Urban 
cities where there are greater population there were actually more drivers than there were total rides. which doesn't seem to make all that sense.
You actually had a I higher chance of getting a ride share in a rural place than you did in either the suburban and Urban places if you look at it from an odds perspective.
But what we did see was that because there were fewer rides in general the data tend to show the cost per ride was much higherin the rural areas which makes sense to some degree.
My assumption is that the distance being driven is further, and it becomes more of an in demad service. But again am wondering then why the values between the drivers vs the rides don't match that 
thinking.

When it came to the to what the multiple-line chart showed us, we saw no mater the city type there seemed to be 
a similar trend of business relative to the population size. Not that it is anything of importance but to take note
that there seemed to be this peak of sorts towards the end of February in every city type. Not sure what the reasoning for that was. It would be interesting to see if that was because the cost of a ride was lower and 
therefore we saw an influx of users, or if that was as a result of a higher price per ride.
It would also be interesting to see the history in each of these city types. I am curious to know how far back this data goes and if there has either been growth in use in specific city types or if we continue to see a steady decline.
